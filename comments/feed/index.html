		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Good, not great product,  great seller.&lt;/strong&gt; Seller was prompt and helpful.  Item itself is good, not great.  The cover doesn&#039;t protect the glass - it&#039;s barely higher.  The release button on the bottom to retract the earphones is difficult.  Once I put the cover on the phone, I can&#039;t get the bottom portion off at all.  My daughter tells me the earphones are tinny, sounding like I&#039;m underwater.  Still, the convenience makes it worth it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Great idea but sub-par product. You can do better.&lt;/strong&gt; Looking around for my earbuds each time I&#039;m about to have a phone chat is a pain so I loved the idea of this case. Sadly, it doesn&#039;t work well. The earbuds are much lower quality than the ones that come with the iPhone &#038; make it difficult to have a conversation on the phone. It&#039;s like you&#039;re straining to hear &#038; the person on the other end reports I sound like I&#039;m very far away. Also, the case doesn&#039;t protect your screen well. Bummer! I so wanted this to work. On a quality of product level,...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Five Stars&lt;/strong&gt; This set has very good sound, seems to be made of high quality materials and it pretty tangle resistant as well. This one is far better and the earbuds have pretty good fidelity as well. I&#039;ve been using this set mostly for phone calls for a few weeks now, and I&#039;m very pleased with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;These are so pretty! The sound is great&lt;/strong&gt; These are so pretty!  The sound is great, no issues. They are very comfortable to use, they stay in your ear and don&#039;t cause any ear aches. I gave these to my mother in law and she loves them! These have a very chic look to them (as much as earbuds can) and they would make a great gift for anyone.]]></description>
